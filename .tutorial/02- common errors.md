- Data read is treated as text. To perform calculations, we need to cast it. In this case, as a float.

```python
import csv # Imports the csv library

with open("January.csv") as file: 
  reader = csv.DictReader(file) 
  line = 0
  
  for row in reader: 
    print (row["Net Total"])
    total += float(row["Net Total"])

print(f"Total: {total}") 
```

The join command has been applied to a string. It's joining those individual characters with a comma between each one.

This won't break your code, just make the output look a bit weird. Removing the `join()` command fixes this.

```python
import csv # Imports the csv library

with open("January.csv") as file: 
  reader = csv.DictReader(file) 
 
  
  for row in reader: 
    print(row["Net Total"])
    total += row["Net Total"] 

print(f"Total: {total}") 
```
